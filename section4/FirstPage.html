		<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is <em>simply dummy text</em> of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
		<p>This is another paragraph that is supposed to say something. There was some text in the video, however it was jiborish and I want to make it mean something. This is my way of making it mean something. All I am doing here is writing words in english that will be on this page. I don't know if that will be enough for you or not but I know that it is enough for me. In this course I am learning about basic HTML right now, which is something I am already well versed in. This make David a bored David.</p>
